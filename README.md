ReadCycle: A medium enterprise selling old books so that quality second hand books purchased from various suppliers can be refurbished and sold at an affordable rate.

The ReadCycle database system has 4 modules namely; customer module, employee module, inventory modules and sales module. 

Platform : XAMPP
Management Tool: Phpmyadmin
Database Management System: MySQL

I acquired extensive knowledge throughout the journey, particularly in constructing our database with MySQL and PHP using css. Through this process, we gained expertise in crafting Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and distinguishing between strong and weak entities, as well as defining relationships among them.
